## Development Notes
* https://medium.com/codemonday/access-wsl-localhost-from-lan-for-mobile-testing-8635697f008

Set up these port forwards for windows to wsl
```
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=8080 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=8080 connectaddress=172.31.54.39
```

They can then be accessed from the local ip address from
```
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
```
# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:
# [network]
# generateResolvConf = false
nameserver 172.31.48.1
```
Test from wsl terminal:
```
curl http://172.31.48.1:8080
```
Delete with:
```
netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenport=8080 listenaddress=0.0.0.0
```
